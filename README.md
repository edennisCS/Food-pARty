# Food-pARty
AR Group Project

A game made in Lens Studio aimed at Kids but also fun for a broader audience, where you use your mouth to eat the falling Christmas food, and on later level food that moves in from the sides. Eat the healthier food to get more points, unhealthy food means your face gets fatter and you lose points and health. All health gone leads to a game over.
